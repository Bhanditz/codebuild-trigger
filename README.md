# CodeBuild Trigger

A simple [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function designed to trigger [CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) on pushes to [CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) (because for some reason, that's not possible by default ðŸ˜œ).

Based heavily on [this example](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/use-aws-codecommit-lambda-trigger-codebuild-container-trevor-sullivan/) from Trevor Sullivan.
